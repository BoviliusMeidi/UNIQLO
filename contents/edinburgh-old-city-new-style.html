          Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, a constituent country of the
          United Kingdom, and the second largest city in Scotland after Glasgow.
          Located on the east coast of Scotland, Edinburgh sits along the
          southern shore of the Firth of Forth.

              well as the first UNIQLO store in Scotland. The cityscape of
              Edinburgh was one of the inspirations for this season's
              collection, as well as the people who wear LifeWear in the fall.

            Today, Stockbridge is one of Edinburgh's most popular neighborhoods.
            Local shops line the old buildings and quiet cobbled streets. Katie,
            walking in front of the long-established local cheese shop “I. J.
            Mellis” is the owner of The Coffee Cabinet, a new coffee shop that
            opened on the east side of the city in April. Her reversible jacket
            matches the creamy gray streets that sparkle in the morning sun.

              Holyrood Park is a park located to the east of the city center and
              home to Arthur's Seat, which commands majestic views of the city.
              On the edge of the park, there is a former brewery that is home to
              a group of thriving businesses. Among them is a coffee shop run by
              Finnan who enjoys wearing UNIQLO sweaters to work. “Spaceboy
              Coffee started as a small business built from things that were
              around me, like bike chains,” he explains, demonstrating the wit
              that characterizes Edinburgh today.

              years of history.

                  “We want to be the storytellers of Scottish crafts,” says
                  Hugo, looking fashionable in a brown shirt. Two years ago, he
                  opened the Bard gallery in the harbor area of Leith, located
                  north of Edinburgh, with his partner James, an architect, who
                  can be seen wearing a Milano cardigan. The interior of the
                  gallery, designed by James, is filled with the work of artists
                  they discovered during their travels around Scotland.

              Living in Edinburgh quickly teaches you about how weather is an
              aspect of life in the city, and as a result, we have such a
              diverse wardrobe, that UNIQLO's arrival in Edinburgh was met with
              great excitement and relief. Summer days usually start with a
              cloud of fog - or as we call it “The Haar” - coming in from the
              Firth of Forth. It's not unusual to see commuters wearing winter
              jackets in August. But the funny thing about Edinburgh's weather
              is that, just as everyone is getting to work, The Haar disappears.
              As the cold clouds evaporate, the temperature can rise up to 10
              degrees in a matter of minutes. To cope with this dramatic
              situation, locals would put on thick layers of clothing and then
              take them off one by one. Thus, there are clothes everywhere, in
              homes, offices and public spaces where we spend time. The result
              of this irresponsible habit is like endless karma, we are stuck in
              a cycle of borrowing and returning each other's clothes. Well, as
              long as the sizes match...

            Grace is active in a variety of activities, gigging several times a
            week as the lead singer of local band Grace & the Flat Boys, as well
            as working as a model and youth worker supporting child development.
            “These pants are so stretchy!” exclaims Grace, highlighting the
            flexibility of the latest skinny jeans as we walk along the Water of
            Leith riverbank not far from Bard (above).

                Founded in 1583, the University of Edinburgh is one of the
                oldest higher education institutions in the UK and is home to
                outstanding students from all over the world. Rita, originally
                from Madrid, is a fourth-year student studying psychology and is
                president of the basketball club. There are many historic
                university buildings scattered across the city, such as this
                classic medical school building. “My mom loves it too,” she says
                of the Ultra Light Down, which can be worn even in Edinburgh's
                summer, when temperatures can change dramatically throughout the
                day.

                Ochre is a botanical studio founded in 2020 by six like-minded
                florists. Sarah, one of the founders, takes us on a tour of one
                of her workplaces, a co-managed garden in the northwestern part
                of the city. The flowers grown here are used for projects
                ranging from weddings to window decorations for local shops. She
                pairs a chic short blouson with the latest wide-leg pants for a
                modern office style.

                Born and raised in Edinburgh, Cameron studied design at Napier
                University in his hometown before working independently as a
                graphic designer. He is seen wearing a windproof parka on the
                doorstep of his other workplace, Assai Records, which is located
                south of Edinburgh Castle, a symbol of the city. “It's a city
                rich in culture,” Cameron says, a fact evidenced by the number
                of local shops that have opened around the city to great
                success.

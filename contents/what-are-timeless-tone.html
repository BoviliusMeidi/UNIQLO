            <h3>Tonal Colors</h3>
            <p>
              The Fall & Winter collection is inspired by the colors of two
              cities: Edinburgh, Scotland, a city of cobblestone streets and
              buildings in cool shades of gray and beige; and Stockholm, Sweden,
              a city of modern architecture, surrounded by white and green
              countryside. With the gradation of basic colors, you can have a
              modern collection of clothes whose colors are easy to mix and
              match.

            <p>
              How should accent colors look good in matching outfits? It doesn't
              have to be bright colors, try adding softer shades this season. If
              you're in the city, cool, clean colors like ice blue will work,
              while in the countryside or outdoors, warm pastel pinks are an
              option.

              fall, wide silhouettes can be found in everything from women's
              chinos to trousers and sweat pants. A good top to wear is

              LifeWear is clothing designed to make everyone's life better.
              Simple, high-quality essential clothing with a sense of beauty and
              craftsmanship in every detail. Designed and continuously developed
              to meet the needs of everyone's life.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a way of helping people around the world to explore the
              specifications of these garments and the concepts behind their
              production, we established LifeWear magazine.

              On June 2, 1984, the first store opened in Fukuromachi, Hiroshima
              Prefecture. At that time, the store was still called UNIQUE
              CLOTHING WAREHOUSE. Although the store name has changed now, our
              mission to create essential clothing that everyone can wear
              remains the same. Meanwhile, these classic items have gradually
              evolved, bringing better functionality with the latest materials
              to produce lighter garments and softer materials. We aim for these
              garments to become favorite items that you will wear for years.
              For this excellence to continue, it is important to constantly
              evaluate the entire manufacturing process.

              In this issue, we think about how LifeWear essentials can be
              combined to create new fashion colors. For inspiration, we look
              back to the city and the life that thrives in it. The
              “mix-and-match” seen in Edinburgh, a historic city where charming
              people and students from all over the world gather. A weekend in
              Stockholm, where modern tonal colors are the standard. Or perhaps
              the refreshing casual wear of today's Paris. Each city has its own
              characteristics, as well as its new colors.

              Timeless clothing is clothing that can be worn at any time.
              LifeWear continues to develop with this principle in mind...

              The illustrations for this “Timeless Tone” cover and tutorial are
              by Hanna Peterson, an artist based in Sweden. A former pattern
              designer, her work shows a detailed exploration of textiles and
              has an impressively soft, natural touch.

              B Magazine is a documentary magazine from South Korea that
              introduces one brand in each issue, and selects “well-balanced
              brands” from around the world. Celebrating our fortieth
              anniversary, they dedicated an entire issue to UNIQLO. This
              special issue includes a history of the company, a visit to our
              office, quotes from artists about their views on UNIQLO, and
              opinions on LifeWear magazine. Scheduled for release in
              mid-September, see the page below for more details.
